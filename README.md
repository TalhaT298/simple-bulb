# Realistic Bulb Toggle Switch

This project demonstrates a simple yet realistic bulb toggle switch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The bulb and switch are designed to mimic real-life interactions, where clicking the switch toggles the bulb's state between on and off.

## Features

- **Realistic Bulb Design**: The bulb changes color and emits a glow when turned on.
- **Interactive Switch**: The switch button moves up and down to indicate the state (on/off).
- **Smooth Transitions**: Smooth CSS transitions for the bulb and switch animations.
- **Responsive Footer**: A footer that adjusts its font size and padding for smaller screens.


## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the Project**: Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
3. **Interact with the Switch**: Click the switch to toggle the bulb on and off.

## Customization

- **Colors**: You can customize the colors by modifying the CSS variables in the `:root` selector.
- **Dimensions**: Adjust the dimensions of the bulb, cord, and switch by modifying the respective CSS properties.
